It seems the best way to create alarm app is to use NativeModules. Which is not possible if we use expo.
This project will now focus on other aspects of the clock app like timer, stopwatch etc. until I figure out a way to make alarm possible.

If alarm turns out to be impossible in expo, I'll have 2 options:
1. Eject expo (or whatever is the equivalent term used now) and implement alarm using NativeModules. Needs Java/Kotlin knowledge and Android SDK.
2. Make a separate alarm app using react native cli, no expo. Same as above, use NativeModules
